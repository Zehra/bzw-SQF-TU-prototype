# BZW - (S)elector (Q)uery (F)ilter - (T)ool (U)tility
> When you can't really create a good name for a tool.

## About:
In 3D world creation within BZFlag, BZW is the format used. The grouping of objects enables ease of replication, but at times, this does not lead to workable results. Additionally, there is many times groups of objects which would make excellent prefabrications or templates, but usage of them as a resource would be tedious. 

BZW-SQF-TU enables new possibilities in that regard, which can come extremely helpful in the case of being able to select and research objects or patterns within well designed 3D worlds. In the case of script/algorithm generated worlds, it becomes possible to easily select regions which perform well for 3D worlds and be more easily able to replicate or attempt to better understand the underlying principles within selected areas. This may be expanded on to be used to enhance world generation algorithms which have a capacity to learn by selecting worlds/patterns which prove to have good playability and filter out designs which do not.

The main ability of this utility is how it may be used to easily process data, but at the same time, it has some usage of a tool.

## Utilities:
This is a prototype project/concept for a tool to allow the following to be done with the BZW format:
* Select objects within a region and **group** them as a **single object**.
* Select objects within a region and duplicate it within another region.
* Select objects within a region and shift positioning of them in x,y,z axis.
* Scale selected objects in x,y,z axis.
* Perform any of the **select objects within a region** actions, but only match objects matching a specified query.
* Perform above actions, but with the option of removing objects which match a filter.

## TODO:
* Code
* Documentation
* Documentation of algorithm used
* Improve readme
* Prototype
* (everything else)

## Notes:
* This is a prototype and a concept and nothing more and nothing less
* Since this is a prototype, do not expect much from it
* Since this is a prototype, do not expect high quality production class code from it
* This project is mainly for research purposes.
